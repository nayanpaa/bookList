This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Summary

Constructed an application for users to make a book list. Utilized REST API with Axios to make JSON requests whenever the user adds new books, deletes books, or reopens the application. Used a random photo generator, http://picsum.photos, to add a corresponding image to each book added.
